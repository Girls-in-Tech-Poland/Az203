# Deploying the application to AKS

> **Important**
>
> At this point we are assuming that:
> - Your AKS cluster has been provisioned
> - `kubectl` has been installed
> - You have obtained your cluster credentials and verified that you can use `kubectl` to work with your cluster
> - You have provisioned an ACR
> - You have pushed a container image into your ACR

## Configure the AKS / ACR integration

In order for AKS to consume container images from a private container registry, the cluster operator must typically add a [docker secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line). That is also possible with AKS, however it is not necessary, as the process has been simplified.

In order for the AKS/ACR integration to work, the AKS service principal needs to have the `AcrPull` role within the ACR resource's scope. This can be achieved using:

```bash
az aks update --name <aks-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --attach-acr <acr-name>
```

## Create a Kubernetes deployment

- Open and edit the [deployment.yaml](./k8s/deployment.yaml) containing the k8s deployment manifest, following the instructions inside.
- Execute `kubectl apply -f {path-to-deployment.yaml}`

> **Note**
>
> The usage of `latest` container tag is not a good practice and should be avoided in real production scenarios.
> When using the `latest` tag, ensure that the `imagePullPolicy` is set to `Always` to ensure that the cluster nodes always execute `docker pull` on the container image:
>
> ```yaml
> containers:
>   - name: ng-git-meetup
>     image: <some-container-image>:latest
>     imagePullPolicy: Always
> ```
>
> Again, this is not a good practice.

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

```
kubectl apply -f .\deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/ng-git-meetup-deployment created
```

</details>

- Verify if pods are starting in the `default` namespace by executing `kubectl get pods`

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

```
kubectl get pods
NAME                                        READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
ng-git-meetup-deployment-5678cdc44f-ch7jb   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          13s
ng-git-meetup-deployment-5678cdc44f-fm9sd   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          13s
ng-git-meetup-deployment-5678cdc44f-m7sz7   1/1     Running             0          13s
```

<details>
<summary>Consuming images from the public Docker hub</summary>

In order to consume an image from the public Docker hub, the image name needs to be altered.

```yaml
containers:
  - name: ng-git-meetup
    image: girlsintechpl/ng-git-meetup:latest
```

</details>

## Create a Kubernetes Service

- Execute `kubectl apply -f {path-to-service.yaml}`

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

```
kubectl apply -f .\service.yaml
service/ng-git-meetup created
```

</details>

- Verify if the service is created by executing `kubectl get services`

<details>
<summary>Expected output while the load balancer is being provisioned</summary>

```
kubectl get services
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP      10.0.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        38m
ng-git-meetup   LoadBalancer   10.0.106.216   <pending>     80:31495/TCP   5s
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Expected final output</summary>

```
kubectl get services
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP      10.0.0.1       <none>          443/TCP        39m
ng-git-meetup   LoadBalancer   10.0.106.216   51.124.60.188   80:31495/TCP   95s
```

</details>

- Copy the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the `ng-git-meetup` service
- Open a web browser
- Paste the copied IP address
- Expect the web-page to load

## A weird looking resource group

During the lab a special resource group containing the underlying resource has been created.

`MC_<aks-name>_<resource-group>_location`

- Access the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and examine the resource group's contents

## Conclusion

At this point, we consider Lab01 to have been completed.
