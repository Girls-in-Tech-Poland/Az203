# AKS Deployment

![aks-logo](./img/aks.svg)

In this part of the exercise we will focus on creating an [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), which will act as the hosting platform for this exercise.

## Creating the AKS using the Azure CLI

In order to create an AKS deployment, please use the following command line:

```bash
az aks create \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --name <aks-name> \
    --node-count 2 \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --service-principal <service-principal-id> \
    --client-secret <service-principal-password>
```

> **Parameters**
>
> - `<resource-group>` - the name of your assigned resource group for this lab
> - `<aks-name>` - the name of your aks cluster
> - `<service-principal-id>` - the Id of your service principal
> - `<service-principal-password>` - the password of your service principal

<details>
<summary>Creating AKS service principals yourself when needed</summary>

> **Note**
>
> For the purpose of this lab, a **Service Principal** has been pre-configured for you, however typically this might not be the case. In case you need to setup the **Service Principal** on your own, you can use the following command line to provision the **Service Principal**:
>
> ```bash
> az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment --name <service-principal-name>
> ```
>
> Upon successful execution, this command will yield a reponse similar to:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "appId": "<service-principal-id>",
>   "displayName": "<service-principal-name>",
>   "name": "http://<service-principal-name>",
>   "password": "<service-principal-password>",
>   "tenant": "<azure-active-directory-id>"
> }
> ```
>
> The above **appId** and **password** values can be reused in **az aks create** to provision the AKS using the method described in this exercise

</details>

## Connecting to the AKS Cluster

In order to communicate with the cluster, a kubeconfig file needs to be obtained. This can be achieved using the below method.

### Obtaining the Kubeconfig

The following command will download the necessary kubernetes context information and persist it to a `kubeconfig` file. Upon successful execution, the recently downloaded context will become the active kubernetes context for your k8s commandline tooling: `kubectl`.

```bash
az aks get-credentials --name <aks-name> --resource-group <resource-group>
```

### Obtaining the Kubectl commandline tooling

The [az aks install-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-install-cli) command will install the necessary `kubectl` tooling.

```bash
az aks install-cli
```

### Verifying the cluster connection
Once `kubectl` is installed, execute the following commands to verify that your connection to the cluster is working:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

> *         ng-git-meetup-aks    ng-git-meetup-aks   clusterUser_ng-git-meetup-aks-rgp_ng-git-meetup-aks

>  The currently active context is highlighted with a `*` character in the `CURRENT` column.
